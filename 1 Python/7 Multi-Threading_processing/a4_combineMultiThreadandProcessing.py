"""
ðŸ§µ Multithreading
Runs multiple threads (lightweight subprocesses) within a single process.

Threads share memory.

In CPython, threads are limited by the GIL (Global Interpreter Lock) â€” only one thread executes Python bytecode at a time.

Best for I/O-bound tasks (e.g., web scraping, file reading, network calls).

âœ… Example Use Cases:
Reading multiple files simultaneously.

Making many API calls in parallel.


ðŸ”¥ Multiprocessing
Runs multiple processes, each with its own memory space.

Bypasses the GIL, so it uses multiple CPU cores effectively.

Best for CPU-bound tasks (e.g., image processing, model training).

âœ… Example Use Cases:
Data transformation on large datasets.

Parallel mathematical computations.




âš¡ Can You Combine Both?
Yes! You can combine multithreading and multiprocessing to leverage both:

Use multiprocessing to fully utilize multiple CPU cores.

Inside each process, you can use multithreading for concurrent I/O tasks.

ðŸ”§ Example Use Case:
Multiprocessing to run jobs on separate CPU cores.

Within each process, use threads to download multiple files in parallel.
